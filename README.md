![Solid／Status／Star(1)(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb1a08b8-fb73-467e-841f-0dfcdcb7f133)  Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demon- strated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention.


![Solid／Status／Star(1)(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2493392-0fef-4161-bb10-7ff9ba9af884)  However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. 
To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distil- lation techniques. Specifically, this method first performs domain adaptation fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-7B using medical knowledge-enhanced data. Subse- quently, interpretable soft labels are generated through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is trans- ferred to a lightweight BERT model.
