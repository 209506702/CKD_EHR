# CKD_EHR

CKD-EHRClinical Knowledge Distillation for Electronic Health Records

•Proposes CKD-EHR, the first framework integrating data augmentation with knowledge distillation for EHR analysis.
•Reduces computational costs via efficient teacher model fine-tuning while maintaining high accuracy.
•Enhances medical prediction with a multi-classification head mechanism for nuanced soft label learning.
•Improves clinical decision support by dynamically constructing a medical knowledge base from real-world data.
